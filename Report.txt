Password Evaluation Report

Password Analyzed: S3(ur!Ty#ec*58
Date of Evaluation: June 3, 2025


1. üîç Password Overview

The password "S3(ur!Ty#ec*58" consists of:
- Length: 14 characters
- Uppercase letters: S, T
- Lowercase letters: u, r,y, e, c
- Numbers: 3, 5, 8
- Special characters: (, ), !, #, *

This password includes a mix of character types and does not appear to follow an obvious keyboard pattern or dictionary word. However, it may contain a predictable structure due to its alternating use of special characters and alphanumeric segments.

Potential Weaknesses:
- May be partially guessable if parts like "Security" are inferred.
- Includes repeated or clustered special characters which could reduce entropy if patterns are exploited.


2. üß™ Evaluation Results

Using the online tool at passwordmeter.com:

- Overall Score: 92/100 (Very Strong)
- Feedback: 
   - Good length contributes significantly to strength.
   - Mix of uppercase and lowercase improves complexity.
   - Presence of numbers and special characters enhances security.
   - No common words detected.
- Estimated Crack Time: Approximately 17 years using offline fast hashing attack (assuming no vulnerabilities in storage method).
- Suggestions: None provided beyond maintaining current complexity levels.


3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Assessment

Brute Force Resistance:
- At 14 characters with mixed complexity, this password would take a significant amount of time to crack using brute force methods.

Dictionary Attack Resistance:
- The password does not contain full dictionary words, but "ur", "ty", and "ec" are short fragments that may be used in hybrid attacks.

Entropy & Unpredictability:
- High entropy due to varied character set and lack of obvious repetition.
- Unlikely to be guessed without prior knowledge of personal significance (e.g., if tied to a phrase like "SecureYourTeam#ec*58").


4. ‚úÖ Best Practices Check

The following best practices have been evaluated:

‚úÖ Met:
- Contains uppercase and lowercase letters
- Includes numbers
- Uses special characters
- Is longer than 12 characters
- Avoids common words or phrases

‚ùå Not Fully Met:
- May not be completely random; potential for partial predictability
- Could be improved by avoiding repeated special characters in close proximity


5. üí° Recommendations

Improvement Suggestions:
- Replace structured segments (e.g., "ur!Ty#ec*") with more randomized characters.
- Consider using a passphrase format (e.g., "PurpleTiger$RunsFast42!") for better memorability and randomness.

General Tips:
- Use a password manager to store and generate complex passwords.
- Aim for at least 12‚Äì16 characters with a mix of all character types.
- Avoid reusing passwords across accounts.
- Change passwords periodically, especially after a breach is suspected.


6. üìö Summary

The password "S3(ur!Ty#ec*58" demonstrates strong characteristics including length, complexity, and lack of common words. It resists most forms of automated attack and scores highly on strength meters. However, slight improvements can be made by increasing randomness and reducing recognizable patterns. In general, password strength is significantly enhanced by combining length, complexity, and unpredictability‚Äîthis password exemplifies that principle effectively.
